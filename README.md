# Hispanic-Restaurants
INST327 Database Design &amp; Modeling Final Project
## Overview

This is my final project for my database design and modeling course (INST327) that I took this past fall semester (2021). For this project we were given the task to create a relational database that incorported at least seven tables and at least 15 sample records in each table. As a group, we decided to create a restaurant database that included some Hispanic restaurants established in the DC area. This database was created with the interests of tourists and locals who enjoy the sceneries of Washington, DC and would love to indulge in the Hispanic eateries that a diverse Washington, DC offers. Though this database doesn't incorporate EVERY hispanic restaurant in DC due to the time we had to work on this project, it still provides a great look on how a restaurant database would be composed and function in SQL with realistic outputs.
